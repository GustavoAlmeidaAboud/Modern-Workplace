# Automate your park app with Windows package manager A.K.A Winget

For the 3 - 4  last years I have been using Winget to automate the update of Applications on my envinroments

Note that not all apps can be update with winget, but only the ones available in the Microsoft Github repo and on the Microsoft Store repo there are really many many apps and more developers are adering to Winget.

Fortunatelly since windows x Winget is by default installed on windows and well you can't really uninstall IT :D

sooo

How we Automate Things

Well the idea is to have all the apps being updated right? well we can do it via Remediation Script. where the remediation script will run every day at x time in the day
